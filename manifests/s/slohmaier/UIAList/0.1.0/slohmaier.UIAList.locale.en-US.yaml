ShortDescription: Accessibility tool for screen reader users to quickly navigate UI controls

  Key Features:
  - Instant Control Listing: Shows all controls in the current application window at once
  - Smart Search Filtering: Type to instantly filter controls by name
  - Direct Control Interaction: Click, focus, or double-click any control directly from the list
