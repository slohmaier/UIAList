### Full Description
UIAList is an accessibility tool designed for blind and visually impaired users who rely on screen readers like JAWS, NVDA, or Windows Narrator. This application lists all controls by name and type for the current application with search functionality to quickly find and interact with controls. It saves significant time by eliminating the need for traditional tabbing navigation that is typical with screen readers.

**Key Features:**
• **Instant Control Listing** - Shows all controls in the current application window at once - no more sequential tabbing
• **Smart Search Filtering** - Type to instantly filter controls by name - find what you need in seconds  
• **Direct Control Interaction** - Click, focus, or double-click any control directly from the list
• **Screen Reader Optimized** - Designed specifically for JAWS, NVDA, and Windows Narrator users
• **Time-Saving Navigation** - Eliminate the tedious tab-through-everything approach
• **Global Hotkey Access** - Activate instantly with Ctrl+Alt+U from any application

**How It Works:**
1. Run UIAList in the system tray
2. Press Ctrl+Alt+U or use the tray icon to activate
3. Filter available controls by typing in the search box
4. Navigate with arrow keys and interact with Enter
5. Use dedicated buttons for Click, Focus, or Double-Click actions

**Perfect For:**
• Navigating complex forms without endless tabbing
• Finding specific buttons or controls by name instantly
• Accessing dialog controls without sequential navigation
• Exploring unfamiliar applications efficiently
• Anyone who finds tabbing through interfaces tedious and time-consuming

**Technical Highlights:**
• Built with Qt 6.9+ for reliability and performance
• Leverages Microsoft UI Automation API for comprehensive control discovery
• Multiple interaction patterns: Invoke, Toggle, Selection, Legacy IAccessible
• Mouse simulation fallback for maximum compatibility
• Zero data collection - completely privacy-focused

**System Requirements:**
